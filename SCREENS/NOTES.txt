 **step-by-step** to design a **professional, industry-ready 6-week training course** for **React.js + Node.js + Express.js + PostgreSQL + Tailwind CSS**.



---

 ✅ STEP 1: Define the Course Vision (Very Important)

Before writing syllabus or code, be very clear about **who this course is for**.

 🎯 Target Audience

* Final-year students
* Fresh graduates
* Junior developers
* Career switchers (basic JS knowledge)

 🎓 Outcome (What students can build after 6 weeks)

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

* Build **full-stack applications**
* Use **React professionally (hooks, performance, patterns)**
* Create **REST APIs with Express**
* Design **PostgreSQL databases**
* Style modern UIs with **Tailwind CSS**
* Deploy & explain projects confidently in interviews

👉 This outcome should guide **every topic you teach**

---

 ✅ STEP 2: Decide Course Structure (Weekly + Daily)

**6 Weeks → 5 Days per Week → 2–3 Hours per Day**

Each day should have:

1. **Concept explanation**
2. **Live coding**
3. **Hands-on task**
4. **Mini assignment**

---

 ✅ STEP 3: High-Level 6-Week Syllabus Overview

| Week 2 | Advanced React + State Management             |
| Week 3 | Backend with Node.js & Express                |
| Week 4 | PostgreSQL + API Integration                  |
| Week 5 | Full-Stack Project + Tailwind                 |
| Week 6 | Advanced Topics + Deployment + Interview Prep |
